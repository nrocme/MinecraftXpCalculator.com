This is a HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT web application that calculates the amount of action needed to get to any level specified. EX level 0 to level 30 would require 277 skeleton kills or something along those lines. This app is hosted on my domain name minecraftxpcalculator.com and is using google's free hosting service called firebase. Firebase is command line driven and is simple and easy to set up. Using https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/ you can find tips on how to improve your pages load times if possible this helps you get ranked higher on google search results. It is also important to set your meta data in html as to help guide search engines to your user base. This website is likely done and will not see updates until minecraft 1.17 as it is updated to minecrafts unrealesed 1.16 version. Any questions on the making of this site should be directed to my github account or my professional email if you have access to that. Thank you for checking out my web application.
