# Minecraft_Calc2
Welcome To my simple html project.
The goal of this project is to take your current ingame xp level and a projected level you want to achieve. The "program" takes your level and projected level and current level and calculates how many actions are needed (e.g iron ores mined) to achieve your projected level.
